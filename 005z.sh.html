    The %INC Hash is another special Perl variable that is used to cache
    the names of the files and the modules that were successfully loaded
    and compiled by use(), require() or do() statements.

    Before attempting to load a file or a module with use() or require(),
    Perl checks whether it's already in the %INC hash. If it's there,
    then the loading and therefore the compilation are not performed at all.

    Otherwise, the file is loaded into memory and an attempt is made to
    compile it. do() does unconditional loading -- no lookup in the %INC
    hash is made.
